2. Make sure they have the same filenames as the originals (cyclops.jpg, frank.jpg, etc.)
   
Alternatively, you can modify the image paths in the `game.js` file:

```javascript
const monsters = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: "Vlad the Vampire",
        image: "Assets/your-custom-image.jpg", // Replace with your custom image
        // ...
    },
    // ...
];
```

### Adding Custom Music

To replace the game music:

1. Place your new MP3 files in the `Assets` folder
2. Either name them the same as the originals (round1.mp3, round2.mp3, ending.mp3)
   
Or update the audio source tags in the HTML file:

```html
<audio id="intro-music" loop>
    <source src="Assets/your-custom-round1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<audio id="round2-music" loop>
    <source src="Assets/your-custom-round2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

</audio>
```
